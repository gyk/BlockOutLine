BlockOutLine
========

BlockOutLine is the side-view version of the classic 
[Blockout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockout) game. 
Provided with multiple facades as hint, 
the player needs to interpret these 2D projections and 
rebuild the 3D scene in the mind.

The four panels from left to right show the back, left, 
front, right views (orthographic projections) of the 
cubes respectively, where solid lines represent visible 
edges and dashed lines represent hidden ones.

The goal of the game is to form complete layers and 
gain score points as high as possible.
